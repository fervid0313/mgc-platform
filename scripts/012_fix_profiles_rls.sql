-- Fix RLS policies for profiles table to allow users to create their own profiles
-- This should resolve the empty error objects in profile creation

-- First, check current policies
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    policyname,
    permissive,
    roles,
    cmd,
    qual,
    with_check
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'profiles';

-- Drop existing policies if they're too restrictive
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own profile" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own profile" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert their own profile" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Public profiles are viewable by everyone" ON profiles;

-- Create new, more permissive policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can view all profiles" ON profiles
    FOR SELECT USING (true);

CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own profile" ON profiles
    FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own profile" ON profiles
    FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own profile" ON profiles
    FOR DELETE USING (auth.uid() = id);

-- Enable RLS on profiles table
ALTER TABLE profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Verify the policies were created
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    policyname,
    permissive,
    roles,
    cmd,
    qual,
    with_check
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'profiles'
ORDER BY policyname;

-- Test the policy by checking if a user can create their own profile
-- This should work now with the new policies

-- Also check if the profiles table has the correct structure
SELECT 
    column_name,
    data_type,
    is_nullable,
    column_default
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'profiles'
ORDER BY ordinal_position;
